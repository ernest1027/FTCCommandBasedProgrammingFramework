## About
This is a custom framework for First Tech Challenge robotics SDK to enable command based programming. This framework allows nested parallel and sequential commands during both autonomous/teleoperated periods to be simplified and run synchronously/asynchronously as desired. The framework also defines how subsytems should be implemented in order to work properly with commands. This was inspired by some of the paradigms found in the First Robotics Competition (FRC) library that have yet to make its way to the FTC SDK.
